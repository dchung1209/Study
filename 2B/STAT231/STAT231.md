### Variate

- a characteristic of a unit
- Continuous / Discrete / Categorical / Ordinal / Complex

#### *Examples*

- Breed of dog : **categorical **
- Weight of Dog (kg) : **continuous** (dependiong on scale)
- General health of dog (good, satisfactory, poor) : **ordinal**
- Sex of dog : **categorical**
- Number (0,1, 2, ...) of previous owners : **discrete**



- Type of drink : **categorical**
- Size of drink: **ordinal**
- Volume of liquid: **continuous**
- Number of drinks : **discrete**





### Attribute

- a function of the variates over the population or process

#### *Examples*

- **proportion** of adults in Ontario who own a smartphone
- **average** drop in blood pressure due to a treatment for individuals





### Types of Studies

- Sample survey
  - 









proportion of adults in Onatrio who own a smartphone

average drop





General Polls/Labour Force Survey : Sample Survey



Sample Quantiles

- $q(0.25)$ = lower (first) quantile = $0.25$th quantile = $25$th percentile
- $q(0.5)$ = median = $0.50$th quantile = $50$th percentile
- $q(0.75)$ = upper (third) quantile = $0.75$th quantile = $75$th percentile



$m = (n+1)p$



Interquartile Range (IQR) : the difference beween the upper and lower quantiles

- $q(0.75) - q(0.25)$

Algorithm

1. Calculate $m_1 = (n+1)(0.25)$ and $m_2 = (n+1)(0.75)$
2. if $m$ lies between $a<m<b$, take the average of $y_{a} + y_{b}$
3. Now $q(0.75) - q(0.25)$



Left-skewed/Right-skewed is determined based on where the tail is. 

- If left-skewed, mean < median
- if right-skewed, mean > median
- if symmetric, mean $\approx$ median 



Skewness $g_1$





Kurtosis $g_2$
